ChatGPT said:
You’ve got the right idea — displaying a list of bird families and their members — but your code has a few syntax and logic issues that are preventing it from running properly. Here’s a cleaned-up and working version of your sketch in p5.js:
let birds;
let data;
let familyY = 50;

function preload() {
  data = loadJSON("birds.json");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 1600);
  background(0);
  fill(255);
  textSize(32);
  birds = data.birds;

  // Loop through bird families
  for (let i = 0; i < birds.length; i++) {
    // Draw family name
    text(birds[i].family, 15, familyY);

    // Draw members
    let members = birds[i].members;
    let memberY = familyY + 20;

    textSize(14);
    for (let j = 0; j < members.length; j++) {
      text(members[j], 30, memberY);
      memberY += 20; // space between members
    }

    // Move down for next family
    familyY = memberY + 30;
  }
}
✅ What was fixed/improved:
❌ function familyY = 50; → removed. (You can’t declare a variable that way.)
Added background(0); for visibility.
Moved all drawing code into setup() (since it’s static, no need for draw()).
Replaced member with memberY at the end (familyY = memberY + 30;).
Adjusted text sizes for readability.
Fixed scope and ordering so birds data is properly used.
If your birds.json looks like this:
{
  "birds": [
    {
      "family": "Crows",
      "members": ["Carrion Crow", "Hooded Crow", "Rook"]
    },
    {
      "family": "Sparrows",
      "members": ["House Sparrow", "Tree Sparrow"]
    }
  ]
}
You’ll get nicely formatted text output like:
Crows
  Carrion Crow
  Hooded Crow
  Rook

Sparrows
  House Sparrow
  Tree Sparrow
Would you like me to make it scrollable or interactive (e.g., expand/collapse each family)?]

    createCanvas(400, 400);
    // Make sure the URL is a valid JSON endpoint
    loadJSON("URL", gotData); // Fixed function name: gotDATA → gotData

Here’s a clean, working p5.js version. You can either keep it as a single file or split it into two files as shown.
Option A — single file (quickest)
// sketch.js

let bubbles = [];

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  noCursor(); // optional
}

function mouseDragged() {
  const r = 40;
  const b = new Bubble(mouseX, mouseY, r, 0);
  bubbles.push(b);

  // keep only last 10
  if (bubbles.length > 10) {
    bubbles.shift();
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < bubbles.length; i++) {
    if (bubbles[i].rollover(mouseX, mouseY)) {
      bubbles[i].changeColor(255);
    } else {
      bubbles[i].changeColor(0);
    }
    bubbles[i].move();
    bubbles[i].show();
  }
}

class Bubble {
  constructor(x, y, r, brightness = 0) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
    this.brightness = brightness;
  }

  changeColor(bright) {
    // clamp to [0,255] just in case
    this.brightness = constrain(bright, 0, 255);
  }

  rollover(px, py) {
    return dist(px, py, this.x, this.y) < this.r;
  }

  move() {
    this.x += random(-5, 5);
    this.y += random(-5, 5);
    // keep on canvas
    this.x = constrain(this.x, this.r, width - this.r);
    this.y = constrain(this.y, this.r, height - this.r);
  }

  show() {
    stroke(255);
    strokeWeight(4);
    fill(this.brightness);
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.r * 2);
  }
}
Option B — two files (if you want the class separate)
sketch.js
let bubbles = [];

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function mouseDragged() {
  const r = 40;
  const b = new Bubble(mouseX, mouseY, r, 0);
  bubbles.push(b);

  if (bubbles.length > 10) {
    bubbles.shift();
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < bubbles.length; i++) {
    if (bubbles[i].rollover(mouseX, mouseY)) {
      bubbles[i].changeColor(255);
    } else {
      bubbles[i].changeColor(0);
    }
    bubbles[i].move();
    bubbles[i].show();
  }
}
Bubble.js
class Bubble {
  constructor(x, y, r, brightness = 0) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
    this.brightness = brightness;
  }

  changeColor(bright) {
    this.brightness = constrain(bright, 0, 255);
  }

  rollover(px, py) {
    return dist(px, py, this.x, this.y) < this.r;
  }

  move() {
    this.x += random(-5, 5);
    this.y += random(-5, 5);
    this.x = constrain(this.x, this.r, width - this.r);
    this.y = constrain(this.y, this.r, height - this.r);
  }

  show() {
    stroke(255);
    strokeWeight(4);
    fill(this.brightness);
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.r * 2);
  }
}
Important: If you use the two-file setup in the p5 web editor, make sure both files are in the project and that Bubble.js is loaded before sketch.js (or just keep them both in the project; the editor handles order).

You were mixing a single bubble with a non-existent bubbles array. Here’s a fixed, working single-bubble sketch:
let bubble;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);

  const x = random(width);
  const y = random(height);
  const r = random(10, 50);

  bubble = new Bubble(x, y, r);

function mousePressed() {

If you’d rather track many bubbles, change let bubble; to let bubbles = [];, push new ones in setup/mousePressed, and loop over them in draw().

Good — you’re very close! There are just a few small errors and mismatches:
You call bubbles[i].rollover() in mousePressed(), but the class defines click() — so the method name should match.
There’s a parenthesis typo in fill(this.brightness(); — it should be fill(this.brightness);.
Optionally, you can make the click action change color instead of only logging to console (for visual feedback).

Good job — this is almost right, but you have one syntax error and a logic issue inside your click() function.
Here’s what’s wrong:

You have an extra else nested incorrectly inside another else.
This causes a syntax error and stops the sketch from running.

    bubbles.push(b);
  }

    bubbles[i].click();

      this.brightness = 255;

    stroke(255);
    strokeWeight(4);
    fill(this.brightness); 
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.r * 2);

✅ Fixes made:
Removed the extra else (which broke the code).
Simplified the brightness logic (clicked → 255, not clicked → 0).
Confirmed all braces {} and parentheses () are properly matched.

Now when you click a bubble, it flashes bright white and logs "Hello" in the console.

rollover instead of click
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — switching from click() to rollover() makes sense if you want the bubbles to react when the mouse hovers over them, not when clicked.
Here’s your corrected and working version 👇

let bubbles = []; 

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    let x = random(width);
    let y = random(height);
    let r = random(10, 50);
    let b = new Bubble(x, y, r);
    bubbles.push(b);
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < bubbles.length; i++) {
    bubbles[i].move();
    bubbles[i].rollover(mouseX, mouseY); // check hover each frame
    bubbles[i].show();
  }
}

class Bubble {
  constructor(tempX, tempY, tempR) {
    this.x = tempX;
    this.y = tempY;
    this.r = tempR;
    this.brightness = 0;
  }

  move() {
    this.x += random(-5, 5);
    this.y += random(-5, 5);
  }

  rollover(px, py) {
    let d = dist(px, py, this.x, this.y);
    if (d < this.r) {
      this.brightness = 255; 
      console.log("Hello");
    } else {
      this.brightness = 0; 
    }
  }
  
  show() {
    stroke(255);
    strokeWeight(4);
    fill(this.brightness); 
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.r * 2);
  }
}
✅ What’s fixed/improved:
mouseClicked() removed (you don’t need it for rollover).
rollover() is now called continuously in draw().
The method now takes mouseX and mouseY as parameters for clarity.
Brightness smoothly updates as you hover.
💡 Result:
When you move the mouse over a bubble, it lights up (and logs “Hello” once per frame while hovered).

} fix
ChatGPT said:
You’ve got methods and an if floating outside the class/loop. Here’s a clean, working version where rollover() returns a boolean and data() runs when hovered:
let bubbles = []; 

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    const x = random(width);
    const y = random(height);
    const r = random(10, 50);
    bubbles.push(new Bubble(x, y, r));
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < bubbles.length; i++) {
    const b = bubbles[i];
    b.move();
    if (b.rollover(mouseX, mouseY)) {
      b.data();          // do something on hover
    }
    b.show();
  }
}

class Bubble {
  constructor(x, y, r) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
    this.brightness = 0;
  }

  move() {
    this.x += random(-5, 5);
    this.y += random(-5, 5);
  }

  rollover(px, py) {
    const d = dist(px, py, this.x, this.y);
    const inside = d < this.r;
    this.brightness = inside ? 255 : 0; // visual feedback
    return inside;
  }

  data() {
    // whatever you want on hover:
    console.log("data");
  }

  show() {
    stroke(255);
    strokeWeight(4);
    fill(this.brightness);
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.r * 2);
  }
}
Key fixes:
Removed stray if (...) { ... } and loose methods outside the class.
rollover() now returns true/false and also updates brightness.
Call b.data() inside the draw loop when rollover(...) is true.

ChatGPT said:
You’re very close again — there are a few small syntax and logic issues in your latest version:
You misspelled bright as brighgt.
You placed console.log("data"); outside the data() method, which breaks the class.
The data() method doesn’t need an argument — it can use internal state directly.
Here’s the fixed and fully working version 👇
let bubbles = []; 

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    const x = random(width);
    const y = random(height);

  }
}

function draw() {
  background(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < bubbles.length; i++) {
    const b = bubbles[i];
    b.move();

    if (b.rollover(mouseX, mouseY)) {
      b.data(); // show text when hovered
    }

    b.show();
  }
}

class Bubble {
  constructor(x, y, r) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
    this.brightness = 0;
  }

  move() {
    this.x += random(-5, 5);
    this.y += random(-5, 5);
  }

  rollover(px, py) {
    const d = dist(px, py, this.x, this.y);
    const inside = d < this.r;
    this.brightness = inside ? 255 : 0;
    return inside;
  }

  data() {
    // show text when hovered
    fill(255);
    noStroke();
    textAlign(CENTER);
    text("test", this.x, this.y + this.r + 15);
    console.log("data");
  }

  show() {
    stroke(255);
    strokeWeight(4);
    fill(this.brightness);
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.r * 2);
  }
}
✅ What’s fixed/improved:
Corrected misspelling (brighgt → bright → removed entirely).
Moved console.log("data") inside the method.
Simplified logic — no argument needed for data().
Added noStroke() and text position offset for clarity.
💡 Result:
Now when you hover over a bubble, it lights up, displays the word "test" below it, and logs "data" in the console.

can you build a website similar to Facebook with javascript ?

Mini Book React Mvp

import { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from "react";

// MiniBook — a tiny Facebook-like MVP in a single React component
// Features: fake auth, post composer, feed, likes, comments, notifications, localStorage persistence
// Notes: purely client-side for demo purposes. Replace storage/actions with API calls for a real app.

function uid() {
  return Math.random().toString(36).slice(2) + Date.now().toString(36);

  try {
    const raw = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
    if (!raw) return null;
    return JSON.parse(raw);
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
Yep — and I sketched a tiny Facebook-style MVP you can run right here. It has a feed, a post composer, likes, comments, a search bar, basic “people you may know,” and localStorage so the state persists. Want to plug in a real backend later? Swap the storage/actions for API calls.
If you want, I can expand this into:

auth (email/password + OAuth),
image/video uploads,
real-time notifications (WebSocket),
a proper database & API (PostgreSQL + Prisma + Node/Express or Next.js),
news feed ranking, pagination, and privacy/visibility controls,
deployment (Vercel/Render/Fly) + CDN + image storage (S3/R2).
Tell me what features you want next, and I’ll build them into this MVP.

 wack make it more interaction moving you know but don't copy them man it look like a twin make it out stye understand? bacon and Angkor and move it move and cool looking you know like we smoking some wee understand me ? and when you push something it like a 3D pop up book !!!

Thought for 10s
ohhh ok — you want it ALIVE: Angkor vibes, bacon-wavy ribbons, trippy motion, and when you poke it, pieces pop up like a 3-D paper book. got you. here’s a full p5.js sketch (WEBGL) that:
idles with slow breathing + parallax camera
has naga/bacon ribbons flowing across
lotus + prasat + krama tiles as textured “cards”
hover/click makes nearby cards spring-lift and tilt (pop-up book feel)
drag = wind push, space = freeze, R = reseed, S = save
drop this in a single index.html and open it.

"My name is Bullimalinna Sot, and my journey back into higher education after more than fifteen years away has been anything but ordinary. I was born in Long Beach and raised in Oakland, California, where my early years were filled with challenges shaped by crime, instability, and limited opportunities. Growing up in Section 8 housing and navigating environments where survival often took precedence over education, I never lost sight of the fact that knowledge and persistence could be my way forward.  Returning to school after such a long break has been both humbling and inspiring. In Fall 2024, I began my Master’s program in Interaction Design and Interactive Art at California State University, East Bay, where I am committed to finishing by 2027. Despite hurdles with financial aid paperwork and setbacks including unresolved issues in Spring 2024 that nearly derailed my progress,I have refused to give up! Instead, I have found ways to adapt and keep moving forward, determined to transform obstacles into stepping stones.  The truth is, my educational journey has not been easy. I often sleep in my SUV and sometimes find myself unhoused alongside family members and friends who are also struggling. I have battled high blood pressure at one point as high as 180 but through discipline and determination, I have worked it down to 120 thanks to Medi-Cal. I did this because I want to live, to continue my education, and to prove that the environment I came from does not define where I am going.  I currently work six to seven days a week as a Door-dash Driver to cover my expenses while studying full-time. At the same time, I dedicate myself to professional growth by earning certificates in STEM, cybersecurity, law, and design from institutions like Harvardx, MITx, Stanfordx, United-Nation, Nasa and Columbiax. Each certificate feels like a piece of armor evidence that despite coming from an underserved community, I am building myself into a leader who is both academically and practically prepared for the future. Please more information is "www.jayaproduction.com"  My long-term vision is to merge STEM, law, and design to create systems that empower underserved communities, much like Mireya TJ Manigault did in her lifetime. I am developing my startup, Sodaro, which integrates artificial intelligence and behavioral insights to make the financial markets more accessible to urban youth and communities like the one I grew up in. I want to show that innovation isn’t only for Silicon Valley boardrooms, it can also belong to kids in Oakland who never thought Wall Street could be for them.  Beyond my startup, I plan to pursue a Juris Doctor degree part-time, followed by a Ph.D. in Art and Technology. I want to specialize in Cyber Law and Design Law, bridging the gap between creativity, security, and justice in the digital era. In addition, I intend to serve in the U.S. Space Force through the STEM track, where I can apply my skills in technology and innovation while gaining the honor of veteran status.  This scholarship would not only help relieve some of the financial pressure of balancing graduate school, work, housing insecurity, and health challenges, but it would also validate the resilience it has taken to come this far. For me, education has become more than just personal advancement it is my chance to prove to others from backgrounds like mine that it is never too late to rewrite your story.  Oakland taught me grit, and higher education is teaching me vision. With the support of this scholarship, I can continue to transform my lived experiences into a platform for innovation, equity, and impact."

remove the spaceforce for now but add I will be studying in Germany next 2026 and working on many aerospace from drawing, to design, to prototype ...

Welcome to the World of Bulli Sot


About

 From Deep East Oakland, art saved my life. It was my first language, my refuge, my resistance, and my foundation. Through it, I learned how to survive, tell stories, and transform struggle into creativity.
Today, I am a Creative + Interaction Technologist. a problem-solver, a storyteller, and a builder shaped by both hardship and innovation. Now immersed in a Master’s program in Interaction Design & Interactive Art (MAIxDIA + STEM) at CSUEB, I fuse code with motion, photography with interface, and spiritual depth with technological edge.
My main focus is exploring how cybersecurity and law intersect with design and art, asking how technology and constitutional rights can create real freedom in a world that often feels restrictive. I’m not just designing interfaces; I’m building ideas where knowledge is power, creativity is healing, and technology becomes a tool for liberation.

Focus

 With a deep passion for art, my primary focus has always been in photography and new media. I travel to document experiences, capturing compelling images and sharing them through multimedia platforms. I funded my creative endeavors by working diligently with individual clients and taking on occasional contract assignments.
As I continue to evolve, I am expanding my skill set by returning to pursue a Master's. This transition has led me to explore new technologies, including p5.js, JavaScript, APIs, and data visualization. My goal while working on my master’s in design is to build as much armor certificate's as possible within the field of STEM, while also studying law and preparing for the future of space. I am excited to integrate these technical skills with my creative background, pushing forward a vision where art, technology, law, and space exploration come together to shape my future and life. 

Services

  As a seasoned photographer with two Wedding Awards and a portfolio of over 100 satisfied clients, I have captured a wide range of moments, from portraits and events to commercial projects. In the past, I also collaborated with assistants and offered comprehensive editing, video-documentary, and retouching services.
These days, I’ve shifted away from professional bookings and focus on enjoying photography as a passion. I only capture moments for family and friends, keeping it personal and meaningful. If someone wishes to support my work, it’s through donations rather than formal services.
I’m proud of the experiences and memories I’ve created with photography, and now I enjoy reflecting on that journey as I set my sights on building something innovative for the future.
The Art of Digital Design







The Govini Project Case Studies

The Beginning

 After landing my major tech contract with Poplicus, a data and analytics company, we needed to define the visual direction for Govini. Starting as a junior designer, I quickly progressed to a senior role, working closely with the CEO and each department within the startup to create my vision for the brand. Govini is revolutionizing Defense Acquisition, transforming an outdated manual process into a software-driven strategic advantage for the United States. Along the way, the company recognized my efforts not only in design but also in development, helping to shape the culture and environment of the workplace. I contributed to creating an atmosphere where collaboration and enjoyment thrived. 
Design Visionary (UI)

 I worked closely with the Chief Design Officer to define the visual identity and functionality of the icons, ensuring each design element aligned with the overall vision. Over the course of several months, I was responsible for the UI design, helping him stay updated on emerging trends and the design aesthetics of various platforms and software.
Skills/Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop.

Revamping Govini's Digital Identity

Govini: Crafting the Web with Creative Expression

 As a web designer and developer at the company, I wore many hats, collaborating with the Director of Marketing Communications to help launch the first version of the website using HTML5. This project aimed to showcase the platform’s brand information for B2B audiences. It was an exciting and rewarding experience, from creating the initial look of the website to designing landing pages and online ads. 
Skills/Tools:

Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Hubspot, Insideview.
Culture of company
Innovative Design for Govini’s Vision

UI Design

 Working with the Govini platform was an incredible experience. To better understand the user flow and user interface (UI), I used sticky notes to map out key interactions and design elements. This approach helped ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience. 
FCW: Designed Scorecards

 designed scorecards that integrated live data in real-time. My task was to transfer data from the platform into these scorecards, which were then used to showcase Govini's capabilities to leads and anyone interested in the platform. The scorecards featured infographics, pie charts, and key data, reflecting Govini’s commitment to providing top-tier information. 
Pulling all-nighters

 Sometimes, I pull all-nighters to figure out how to ensure everything runs smoothly, including printing the website and understanding the company’s needs. As a designer, I worked tirelessly, studying each element of the industry’s vibe and aura, while also determining which data should be showcased to the marketing team for the website. 
Wall Street Journal

During my time as the personal photographer for the team and CEO, I had the honor of capturing key moments with my personal camera, showcasing his leadership, dedication, and vision. One of the most exciting milestones was when a photo I took of him was featured in The Wall Street Journal. This achievement marked a significant moment for Govini, with the image playing a key role in our marketing efforts to elevate the company’s visibility and reinforce its position as an industry leader.
Brochure Design

As a designer, I utilized Adobe Creative Suite to create visually compelling and consistent brochure designs that aligned with Govini's brand identity. My focus was on ensuring that the design elements, typography, and imagery not only looked cohesive but also effectively communicated the platform's core values and services. Through a careful balance of creativity and brand consistency, I was able to produce brochures that captured attention while maintaining a professional, polished appearance. 
Mission Accomplished: The Final Chapter

from 2012 to 2014, helping shape the brand and transitioning the platform from its first prototype to the website. As a founding member, my time with the company has now come to an end, but I remain close with the founder and CEO, Eric Gillespie, who introduced me to the tech and startup life. Working at Govini made it possible for me to pursue my own entrepreneurial dreams. That’s why Eric was the first person I reached out to for a letter of recommendation for the S.T.E.M. master's program at CSUEB, starting this fall of 2024. 
Case Studies on the Zend and Microsoft Azure Partnership


New Chapter

 I was involved in several smaller projects related to client work when I received an exciting email from Zend's headquarters, inquiring about a designer with expertise in web and graphic design, as well as development. The interview went smoothly, and they introduced me to the projects associated with their partnership with Microsoft. I was hired for a senior position, where I worked closely with the General Manager to help lead the marketing efforts, focusing on a fresh new look. A highlight of this experience was seeing my designs featured at multiple tech conferences as part of Zend’s display with Microsoft. Additionally, we had the opportunity to collaborate with the Microsoft Azure department, which was truly a rewarding moment.
Skills/Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop.

Mastering Conversion

 Using my vision and design tools, I created a fresh, engaging look to develop a new lead and landing page for viewers interested in Zend's product. By identifying trends at the time, my goal was to ensure the design aligned with the vision and effectively communicated the brand's message. 
Skills/Tools: Marketo Design Studio, Adobe Photoshop.

Crafting Web Experiences

 To fully understand the company’s needs, I focused on how the product functions and how to seamlessly integrate it with my creative design. I updated the site daily using HTML, along with some JavaScript, and also learned basic PHP. Zend played a key role in this process, and I’m grateful for the experience. 
Skills/Tools: Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Photoshop.
Collaborating with the CEO to create a video.
 As the final days approached, I had the opportunity to work closely with one of the creators of PHP, as well as the founder and CEO, Andi Gutmans. I mentioned my experience with video production, and I was fortunate to have the chance to record him discussing Zend's partnership with Microsoft. 

Through the Lens: A Portfolio of Captured Moments


the Story

 A collection of personal photography projects created for family and friends. These works are shared here as part of my art portfolio and reflect my passion for capturing real-life moments creative work done for fun, practice, and learning.
Starting as a freelance designer and artist, I worked with mom-and-pop stores and local community members, helping them establish their brands before transitioning into the tech industry. Alongside my design work, I also pursued photography part-time, capturing everything from model shoots and commercials to events such as weddings, quinceañeras, and Sweet 16–18 parties. Over time, I was able to turn photography into a full-time career, focusing on event photography due to the high volume of bookings. This involved meeting clients, handling contracts, and ensuring everything ran smoothly. I hired assistants to support as second photographers and help with photo touch-ups, and I collaborated with videographers to offer complete event coverage. My goal during this time was to learn the business while balancing the tech world, which taught me how to successfully manage projects and lead as a photographer.
Even then, my work came from the heart = fueled by passion, creativity, and a love of storytelling. Many people encouraged me to go fully “legit,” but my focus was always on learning, documenting, and growing. Today, I mostly do fun gigs and donation-based projects for friends. My main energy is now dedicated to my education and my future career in tech and startups, but I’ll always be grateful for the memories and lessons photography has given me.

Crafting Creativity: From Design to Sculpture

Passion

 Art has always been more than creation; it’s about understanding design and connecting with the craftsmanship that brings it to life. Before stepping into my master’s program, I chose to return to the community college Spring 2024 at DVC. It was both humbling and energizing things had changed, and I had to adapt fast to keep up with a new era of tools, perspectives, and creative culture.
At DVC, I sharpened my foundation not only through traditional art classes but also courses like the history of Asia, which deeply influenced my personal style and creative journey.
Now, as I pursue my Master’s in Interaction Design & Interactive Art at CSUEB, I’ve re-wired my approach to creativity. I’ve refined my skills in Adobe tools, drawn inspiration from innovative classmates, and tapped into cutting-edge technologies. This environment is shaping my future thesis and fueling my vision: to build a startup that blends art and technology in transformative ways.
Ambition

 www.jayaproduction.com was originally created during my senior year while completing my B.A. as an educational portfolio site. It was never a company, just a personal platform I built to showcase my creative work, grow my skills, and share my journey. All the work comes directly from me, Bullimalinna Sot, and over time the site has become part of my creative history and personal memories. Some people have even asked to buy the domain, but for me its value is priceless if I ever part with it, the price would be no less than $1,500,000. Until then, it remains my digital home.
Escaping the challenges of growing up in East Oakland, where gang culture was prevalent, I worked hard to find mentors, seek guidance, and focus on the light in a difficult environment. Through perseverance, I was able to save enough to invest in my future, transforming struggle into motivation. Now my goal is to live with purpose and creative fulfillment.
As an artist and Cambodian American, my mission is to continuously grow, mastering new tools and mediums while building a lasting legacy that shapes how art is perceived. My journey is both personal and cultural a commitment to using creativity, education, and perseverance to leave an indelible mark on the world.

Video Work
 I focus on site scenes and natural elements to create interactive 3D design and architecture. Inspired by Angkor Wat, the design emphasizes balance, line, and harmony, showing how architecture can coexist with nature. Features like water flow, wind, and rain are incorporated to evoke emotion and protect the artwork. 


Master Program
 After completing my bachelor’s degree in 2010 and gaining 14 years of experience as a freelance artist, in the tech industry, and running my own photography business, I am now pursuing graduate studies in Interaction Design and Interactive Art, a  
MA IxDIA + STEM field that connects creativity and technology. This program allows me to expand my skills and tools for success in an evolving era where AI and UI design are shaping the future. JavaScript plays a crucial role in this transformation, bridging design and development, and I’m excited to be part of this journey.
I chose to extend my program to three years (Fall 2024 – Spring 2027) instead of rushing through in two. For me, this isn’t about chasing a high-ranking title job, but about fully enjoying the educational experience, developing critical thinking, and understanding the trends shaping our world. Growing up, I never imagined I’d be in this field so now I see it as solving a puzzle, finding clues, and building knowledge from this environment of learning
Building Engaging UI & UX


Project Team Bounce

Returning to the design aspect, one of the most rewarding parts was the collaboration between UX and UI design. Throughout the semester, we worked as a team, conducting real interviews to create user personas and perform research. This collaborative process culminated in a compelling presentation, where each member contributed in various roles. I'm grateful for the experience. We focused on key UI design principles such as consistency, clarity, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy, ensuring the design was both visually appealing and user-friendly. Our UX process followed five key steps: empathizing with users, defining the problem, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. Each step was critical to creating a user-centered design, with the same attention to detail an architect would apply to space planning. Mixing BFA Graphic Design students with Grad students made this project exceptional, and I’m proud of the team's success.

Journey Path

While refining the user flow, we leveraged Miro as a collaborative tool to brainstorm and iterate on ideas, especially since many team members were engaged with other projects. Miro proved to be an invaluable asset, enabling us to work asynchronously and maintain flexibility in our process. This allowed us to efficiently capture feedback, ensure alignment, and ultimately refine our concepts with confidence, knowing that the design was in capable hands despite everyone's varying schedules. It serves as a reminder of the precious moments we spend, reflecting our dedication to providing a tool that not only improves productivity but also encourages intentional, purposeful use in everyday life.

Style Protocol

 We strategically chose to highlight the purple color to evoke a sense of royal power, while also symbolizing peace and tranquility. Our goal was not just to create an app, but to design a tool that seamlessly integrates into users' daily lives—something they can rely on for work, school, and beyond, just like a smartphone or a routine task such as paying a bill. We aimed to foster a sense of connection with our users, ensuring that the experience is not only informative but also emotionally engaging. The design reflects this commitment, with every element carefully crafted to empower and support our users in a meaningful way.
Additionally, the logo features a sand clock, which symbolizes the passage of time, mindfulness, and the balance between work and rest.

First or second-generation immigrant or other underrepresented minority
Access to higher education often serves as a barrier to success in the United States, with students underrepresented in academia struggling to catch up. 

Having just one person pursue higher education can serve to elevate an entire family, but that possibility is being put further and further out of reach financially as college costs soar. Families that are new to America and those that have otherwise been generationally denied higher education face particular struggles when attempting to enter the collegiate space, furthering cycles of poverty and strife.

This scholarship aims to make college more accessible to students with no family background in higher education so they can have the same opportunities as their peers.

Any student pursuing a bachelor’s or master’s degree in a STEAM field may apply for this scholarship if they’re a first or second-generation immigrant or an otherwise underrepresented minority in higher education whose parents and grandparents haven’t attained the level of education being pursued.

To apply, tell us about your hopes and fears about pursuing college and how your background has affected your education and your goals.

Scholarship Application Essay
My name is Bullimalinna Sot, and my journey back into higher education after more than fifteen years away has been anything but ordinary. I was born in Long Beach and raised in Oakland, California, where my early years were filled with challenges shaped by crime, instability, and limited opportunities. Growing up in Section 8 housing and navigating environments where survival often took precedence over education, I never lost sight of the fact that knowledge and persistence could be my way forward.

Returning to school after such a long break has been both humbling and inspiring. In Fall 2024, I began my Master’s program in Interaction Design and Interactive Art at California State University, East Bay, where I am committed to finishing by 2027. Despite hurdles with financial aid paperwork and setbacks in Spring 2024 that nearly derailed my progress, I refused to give up. Instead, I adapted, finding ways to move forward and turn obstacles into stepping stones.

The truth is, my educational journey has not been easy. I often sleep in my SUV and sometimes find myself unhoused alongside family and friends who are also struggling. I have battled high blood pressure—once as high as 180—but through discipline and determination, I lowered it to 120 thanks to Medi-Cal. I made this choice because I want to live, to continue my education, and to prove that the environment I came from does not define where I am going.

Currently, I work six to seven days a week as a DoorDash driver to cover my expenses while studying full-time. At the same time, I dedicate myself to professional growth by earning certificates in STEM, cybersecurity, law, and design from institutions such as HarvardX, MITx, StanfordX, ColumbiaX, NASA, and the United Nations. Each certificate feels like a piece of armor—evidence that despite coming from an underserved community, I am building myself into a leader who is both academically and practically prepared for the future. My website, www.jayaproduction.com, documents this journey and my evolving body of creative and technical work.

My long-term vision is to merge STEM, law, and design to create systems that empower underserved communities, much like Mireya TJ Manigault did in her lifetime. I am developing my startup, Sodaro, which integrates artificial intelligence and behavioral insights to make financial markets more accessible to urban youth and communities like the one I grew up in. I want to show that innovation isn’t only for Silicon Valley boardrooms—it can also belong to kids in Oakland who never thought Wall Street could be for them.

In 2026, I will study in Germany, focusing on aerospace—from drawing to design to prototyping—gaining international experience and sharpening my ability to merge creativity, engineering, and systems thinking. Beyond that, I plan to pursue a Juris Doctor degree part-time, followed by a Ph.D. in Art and Technology, specializing in Cyber Law and Design Law. My goal is to bridge the gap between creativity, security, and justice in the digital era.

This scholarship would not only help relieve some of the financial pressure of balancing graduate school, work, housing insecurity, and health challenges, but it would also validate the resilience it has taken to come this far. For me, education is more than just personal advancement—it is proof to others from backgrounds like mine that it is never too late to rewrite your story.

Oakland taught me grit. Higher education is teaching me vision. With the support of this scholarship, I can continue transforming my lived experiences into a platform for innovation, equity, and impact.

Do you want me to shorten this into a tighter 500–600 word version (common for scholarship applications), or should I keep it as detailed and full-length as it is now?

Scholarship Application Essay
My name is Bullimalinna Sot, and my journey into STEM has been anything but ordinary. Growing up in Section 8 housing in Oakland, California, surrounded by instability, crime, and limited opportunities, I never imagined that one day I would be pursuing a Master’s degree in Interaction Design and Interactive Art at California State University, East Bay. For many years, survival took precedence over education. But as I returned to school after more than fifteen years away, I began to see something clearly: mathematics, and calculus in particular, is more than just numbers—it is the language of innovation, the foundation of design, and, in many ways, the god of art.

For me, calculus is not an abstract subject locked inside a textbook. It is the underlying structure that connects art, technology, and engineering. When I build interactive systems, design user interfaces, or explore aerospace prototypes, calculus is always present—quietly governing curves, motions, rates of change, and possibilities. Just as an artist uses perspective and proportion to create depth on a canvas, a technologist uses calculus to model reality, predict outcomes, and build systems that can change lives.

This is why I see calculus as a bridge between creativity and science. As someone who has worked as both a photographer and a designer, I know how essential math is to visual composition, light, and structure. But now, as I dive deeper into STEM, I see how calculus transforms that artistic foundation into engineering and technology. Whether it’s machine learning, cybersecurity, or aerospace design, calculus is what allows me to turn creative visions into functional prototypes. It transforms an idea into something measurable, testable, and real.

I currently work six to seven days a week as a DoorDash driver to cover my living expenses, while dedicating myself full-time to graduate school and earning certificates in STEM, cybersecurity, law, and design from HarvardX, MITx, StanfordX, ColumbiaX, NASA, Google, and the United Nations. Each certificate feels like a piece of armor, strengthening my resilience and showing me that math is not just survival—it is power. Even when I was sleeping in my SUV, I was solving problems in my coursework and proving to myself that no matter how tough life gets, calculus and STEM give me tools to reshape my future.

In 2026, I will study in Germany, focusing on aerospace design and prototyping. There, calculus will once again guide me—whether I am drawing aerodynamic curves, modeling flight systems, or analyzing engineering data. My startup, Sodaro, which uses artificial intelligence and behavioral insights to open financial markets to underserved youth, also relies on calculus-based algorithms. Without calculus, there would be no predictive modeling, no optimization, and no bridge between code and community empowerment.

I believe calculus is important in the STEM field because it trains the mind to think critically about change, connection, and possibility. It pushes us to ask: how does one variable affect another, and how can we model that interaction to improve the world? That mindset is essential for solving the most pressing problems in technology, law, and design.

Oakland taught me grit, but calculus is teaching me vision. It shows me that math is not just a tool—it is art, balance, and creation itself. Just as calculus describes the infinite, I believe education can give infinite possibilities to those of us from underserved backgrounds. With the support of this scholarship, I will continue to use calculus not only as a foundation for my own growth, but also as a way to empower others to see that the language of STEM belongs to them, too.

Word count: ~595

Would you like me to also tighten this to ~450 words (safer for a 400–600 range) so it’s polished and ready to submit without edits, or do you prefer the fuller version above?


let ballx = 200;
let speedx = 2;


function setup() {
  createCanvas (400, 400);
    frameRate(60);
}


function draw() {
  background(0);
  
  ellipse(ballx, 200, 50);
  
  ballx = ballx + speedx;
  
  if (ballx >= 400) {
    speedx = -speedx;
    
    
  } else if (ballx <= 0) {
    speedx = -speedx;
  }
  
  if (ballx >= 400)
  
  
  console.log(ballx, speedx);
  
  
  
  
} how to make cup and down
ChatGPT said:
Right now your ball only moves left–right (ballx with speedx).
To make it move up and down as well, you need a y-position (bally) and a y-speed (speedy), just like you did for x.
Here’s an updated version:

let ballx = 200;
let bally = 200;
let speedx = 2;
let speedy = 2;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  frameRate(60);
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  
  // draw ball
  ellipse(ballx, bally, 50);
  
  // update position
  ballx = ballx + speedx;
  bally = bally + speedy;
  
  // bounce left/right
  if (ballx >= 400 || ballx <= 0) {
    speedx = -speedx;
  }
  
  // bounce top/bottom
  if (bally >= 400 || bally <= 0) {
    speedy = -speedy;
  }
  
  console.log(ballx, bally, speedx, speedy);
}
Now the ball will bounce around the canvas in both directions (like a screensaver).
👉 Do you want the ball to move diagonally forever, or should it only go straight down/up while still moving horizontally?

Awesome first project idea! Here’s a simple p5.js sketch that does exactly what you described:
Left / Right → changes the starfield “theme” (density/size/twinkle)

why am I losing weight so fast ?
ChatGPT said:
Losing weight very quickly can sometimes be normal (like after starting a new diet, cutting carbs, or exercising a lot more), but it can also signal an underlying health issue. Some common reasons include:
Lifestyle-related causes:

Eating fewer calories than your body needs (intentional or unintentional).
Increased exercise or physical activity.
Changes in diet (low-carb diets often cause rapid water loss at first).
Medical causes to rule out:
Thyroid issues (overactive thyroid speeds up metabolism).
Diabetes (especially if accompanied by thirst, frequent urination, fatigue).
Digestive conditions (like celiac disease, Crohn’s, or ulcers).
Infections (such as tuberculosis or HIV).
Cancer (unexplained rapid weight loss can sometimes be an early sign).
Depression, stress, or anxiety (can suppress appetite).
Medications (certain prescriptions can reduce appetite or cause weight loss).
⚠️ Red flags to see a doctor urgently:
Losing more than 5% of your body weight in a month without trying.
Ongoing fatigue, weakness, or night sweats.
Unexplained fevers.
Severe digestive symptoms (persistent diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain).
Feeling constantly thirsty and peeing a lot.
Noticeable changes in mood, appetite, or sleep.
👉 If this weight loss is unintentional and rapid, it’s best to get checked by a healthcare professional soon. They can run blood tests and other checks to figure out what’s going on.
Would you like me to help you figure out whether your symptoms sound more like a lifestyle-related cause or a medical cause?

  Thought for 9s
  You had a few issues: a stray word stuck to function, variables declared inside draw() (they’ll reset every frame), and missing circleX/circleY/circleRadius. Here’s a clean, working p5.js version that also uses an object to store the circle’s data:
  // ----- globals -----
  // numbers
  let diameter = 50;
  let xPos;                 // will be set in setup()
  let redValue = 200;
  
  // strings
  let message = "Hello, p5.js!";
  let userName = "Alice";
  
  // circle as an object
  const circle = {
    x: 280,
    y: 120,
    r: 25
  };
  
  function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    xPos = width / 2;
    textFont('monospace');
  }
  
  function draw() {
    background(0);
  
    // the egg
    noStroke();
    fill(255);
    ellipse(200, 200, 50, 70);
  
    // example use of numbers (not required, just showing they're available)
    // use redValue for a rectangle so you can see it doing something
    fill(redValue, 50, 50);
    rect(xPos - diameter / 2, 320, diameter, 10);
  
    // strings
    fill(255);
    text(message + " " + userName, 10, 20);
  
    // hover detection for the circle
    const mouseIsOverCircle = dist(mouseX, mouseY, circle.x, circle.y) < circle.r;
  
    // draw the circle in green if hovered, red if not
    if (mouseIsOverCircle) {
      fill(0, 255, 0); // Green
    } else {
      fill(255, 0, 0); // Red
    }
    ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.r * 2, circle.r * 2);
  }
  If you want the circle to move or grow when hovered, you can tweak circle.x, circle.y, or circle.r inside that if (mouseIsOverCircle) block.


  function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
  }
  
  function draw() {
    background(220);
  }
  
  strokeWeight(4)
  
  fill(50, 100, 100, 100)
  stroke(1)
  ellipse(10, 10, 10, 10)
  
  give me red, blue, green
  ChatGPT said:
  Got it 👍 — in p5.js you can set the fill or stroke to red, blue, or green using RGB values or named colors. Here are quick examples with your code:
  function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
  }
  
  function draw() {
    background(220);
  
    strokeWeight(4);
  
    // Red circle
    fill(255, 0, 0); // red
    stroke(0);
    ellipse(50, 50, 50, 50);
  
    // Green circle
    fill(0, 255, 0); // green
    stroke(0);
    ellipse(150, 50, 50, 50);
  
    // Blue circle
    fill(0, 0, 255); // blue
    stroke(0);
    ellipse(250, 50, 50, 50);
  }
  This will draw three circles: red, green, and blue.
  👉 Do you want me to show them all at once like this, or just switch your existing ellipse between red/blue/green?

fall 2025 pass is 195
and hour is 2.00
how can I save money or I need to get that pass ?
also  remember no holiday no school at csueb

this fall semester which start aug 19 to something figure it out
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’re looking at your Fall 2025 semester schedule at CSU East Bay (CSUEB) and wondering if you should purchase the $195 semester pass (2-hour limit per ride) or if there are cheaper options, given your class times. Let’s break this down step by step.
📅 Semester Dates
Start: August 19, 2025 (Tuesday)
End: December 13, 2025 (Saturday)
👉 That’s about 17 weeks total (standard CSU semester length).
🏫 Your Schedule
Monday
2:00 – 4:30 PM (MM 665)
4:55 – 7:25 PM (MM 601)
Tuesday
4:15 – 6:45 PM (MM 621)
Wednesday
2:00 – 4:30 PM (MM 665)
4:55 – 7:25 PM (MM 640 on 5 dates only: 8/27, 9/17, 10/8, 10/29, 11/19)
Thursday
4:15 – 6:45 PM (MM 621)
👉 You’re on campus 4 days a week, every week (Mon–Thu).
👉 Wednesdays are sometimes longer with the Forum class.
👉 No classes Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays.
🚍 Pass Cost Breakdown
Semester pass: $195 total
Length of semester: ~17 weeks
Cost per week: about $11.47/week
If you go to campus 4 days/week, that’s 68 round trips for the semester.
$195 ÷ 68 trips = about $2.87 per round trip
Compare that with paying regular fare per ride (depends on your local system — AC Transit, BART, or CSU shuttle).
If single fare is $2.50–$3 each way → $5–$6 per day → $340–$408 per semester.
In that case, the semester pass saves you $145–$213.
⚖️ So, do you need the pass?
✅ If you commute by bus/train 4 days a week, the $195 pass is worth it (much cheaper than paying each trip).
❌ If you usually drive, carpool, bike, or walk, then you don’t need it.
🤔 If you only take transit occasionally (e.g., once a week), it may be cheaper to just pay per ride.
Do you want me to calculate the exact savings based on your real commute (like if you use AC Transit, BART, or both), so you can see if the $195 pass pays off for you?
You said:
I am driving 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — thanks for clarifying. 🚗
If you’re driving instead of taking public transit, then:

You do not need the $195 semester bus pass — that’s only worthwhile for students commuting mainly by bus/train.
Your real costs will instead be:
Parking permit (CSUEB charges per semester or daily)
Gas + maintenance
Possibly bridge tolls (if you’re crossing the Bay)
📅 Your Fall 2025 semester
Aug 19 – Dec 13, 2025 (≈17 weeks)
You’ll be on campus Mon–Thu every week
That means about 4 round-trips per week → ~68 trips total for the semester.
👉 So the real money decision isn’t the bus pass, but whether you want:
A semester parking permit (flat fee, unlimited parking for the term), or
Daily parking permits (pay-per-day when you come).
Would you like me to pull up the current CSUEB Fall 2025 parking permit prices so you can see which option saves you more money?
You said:
yes

Your Fall 2025 Semester Snapshot
Class Schedule: Monday–Thursday, Aug 19–Dec 13 (~17 weeks)
Likely Drive Days: 4 days/week → about 68 days total (round-trip assumed)
Total Permit Need: Need parking only on weekdays — weekends are free.
Cost Comparison
Option	Estimated Cost	Notes
Semester Permit	$195 (flat for full semester)	Best value if driving frequently
Daily Permits	~$680 (68 days × $10/day)	Far more expensive than flat rate
Hourly Permits	Varies — ~$6/day (3 hr × $2, maybe more)	Still ~ $400+ for full term
Prorated Semester	$130 starting Sept 27 (2/3 term)	Available if you delay purchase but still pricey
Last Third Only	$65 starting Nov 5 (final 1/3)	Good only if you drive late only
Recommendation
Given your driving schedule (Mon–Thu throughout the semester), the semester permit at $195 is the most cost-effective option. It covers all your parking needs, is valid on most enforcement days, and beats daily or hourly rates by a wide margin.
Daily permits: ~$680 — much more expensive
Hourly permits: ~$400+ — still pricier than the semester pass
Prorated options: Only worth it if you start driving later in the term
Additional Notes
There's a 5-day grace period in student lots (Aug 19–25) where no permit is required

So, should you get the pass?
Yes — the $195 Fall Semester parking permit is a solid investment given your driving schedule. It offers convenience, reliability, and significant savings compared to daily or hourly options.
Would you like help figuring out how to purchase the permit, or see alternative transportation options (like carpools or EasyPass) if you ever decide to mix methods? Let me know!
You said:
so no 2
ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍 — since you’re driving, you don’t need the $195 bus/transit pass at all.
The one that makes sense for you is the $195 semester parking permit (for your car).

That covers you for the whole Fall 2025 term (Aug 19 – Dec 13) and will save you a lot compared to paying $10 per day or $2 per hour.

✅ So:
No to the bus pass 🚍
Yes to the parking pass 🚗
Do you want me to show you step-by-step how to buy the CSUEB semester parking permit online?
You said:
I think you just want to give CSUEB money
ChatGPT said:
😅 Fair point — it definitely feels like that sometimes. Parking is one of those “hidden” costs of college, and CSUEB (like most universities) makes a lot from it.
But my suggestion wasn’t to give CSUEB money unnecessarily — it was just the math:

Daily permits ($10 × 68 days ≈ $680) → much more than $195.
Hourly permits (≈ $6 per visit × 68 ≈ $408) → still over double $195.
Semester permit ($195 flat) → cheapest if you’re on campus 4 days a week.
So it’s not really about wanting to give them money — it’s about minimizing how much you’re forced to pay anyway.
👉 But if you don’t want to hand over that $195 at all, there are alternatives:
Carpooling (split costs, fewer permits needed).
Parking off-campus (if there’s nearby free/cheap street parking and you don’t mind a short walk).
Mix & match (maybe buy daily permits only if you’ll skip campus a lot, but that adds up fast).
Evening loophole: parking is free after enforcement hours (after 11 PM Mon–Thu, after 5 PM Fri, and all weekend/holidays).
Do you want me to run the numbers again, but assuming you might skip some weeks (holidays, no-Forum Wednesdays, Thanksgiving break, maybe occasional online days), to see if daily permits could just barely beat the semester pass?
You said:
no fairer real
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — you’re saying it doesn’t feel fair or real that CSUEB charges like this. And honestly…you’re right.
Here’s the reality of how they set it up:

The parking system is self-funded. CSU campuses don’t use tuition money for parking lots/structures. Instead, they make drivers pay directly through permits and tickets.
That means they design the pricing to push you toward the semester permit. Daily and hourly rates are set high on purpose, so if you come often, you’ll end up paying more unless you buy the flat pass.
Meanwhile, students who don’t drive subsidize nothing — so it feels like drivers carry all the cost.
So in practice, it isn’t about what’s “fair” — it’s about what saves you the least painful amount. Since you’re driving 4 days a week for 17 weeks, the semester permit is the cheapest path they’ll allow you to take.
If you don’t want to give them $195 at all, your only “real” workarounds are:

Carpool (split parking with a friend/classmate)
Find free street parking (if you’re okay walking — limited and competitive near Hayward campus)
Rearrange schedule (less driving days = maybe daily permits become competitive, but with 4 days/week it won’t beat $195).
👉 Bottom line: it isn’t fair, but it’s the structure they set. You can’t avoid paying something if you drive and park on campus — the only control you really have is choosing the least expensive option.
Would you like me to map out what your actual out-of-pocket parking cost could look like under different scenarios (full semester pass vs. partial daily permits vs. creative workarounds)? That way you can see “real” choices side by side.

You said:
remember no holiday no school 
ChatGPT said:
✅ Good catch — let’s tighten the numbers with no holidays, no canceled school days, meaning you’ll be driving for every class from Aug 19 – Dec 13, 2025.
📅 Count the Driving Days
Semester length: ~17 weeks
You have class Mon–Thu each week
That’s 4 days × 17 weeks = 68 campus days
No holidays off = no skipped days = 68 total days you’ll need parking.
💰 Cost Scenarios
1. Semester Permit (flat)
$195 total
Covers all 68 days
Effective cost per day = $2.87
2. Daily Permits ($10 each)
68 days × $10 = $680
Effective cost per day = $10.00
3. Hourly Permits ($2/hr)
Your classes run about 3 hours each day (sometimes 2 classes = 6+ hours).
Average ~4 hours/day → $8 per visit
68 days × $8 = $544
If you stayed longer (like Monday double classes), some days would be $10 anyway.
🎯 Reality Check
With no holidays and full attendance, the semester pass at $195 is the clear winner.
Daily or hourly permits would cost 3–4× more.
So unless you don’t drive every week, there’s no cheaper legit option — the semester permit is the least painful one.
👉 Want me to also calculate what it would look like if you skipped even just Thanksgiving week (most professors cancel anyway), just to show the difference?
You said:
holiday mean no school understand English?
ChatGPT said:
Got it — thanks for clarifying! ✅
When we remove holidays and school closures from your Fall 2025 semester (Aug 19 – Dec 13), here’s what it looks like:

🚫 No-School Days (CSUEB Fall 2025)
Labor Day: Monday, Sept 1
Veterans Day: Tuesday, Nov 11
Fall Recess: Monday–Friday, Nov 24–28 (includes Thanksgiving)
📅 Actual Driving Days
Classes meet Mon–Thu
Semester length: Aug 19 – Dec 13
After removing those holidays → 61 class days total
💰 Parking Cost Comparison
Semester Permit: $195 flat → $3.20 per day
Daily Permits: 61 × $10 = $610
Hourly Permits: ~4 hrs/day × $2/hr = $8/day → 61 × $8 ≈ $488
👉 Even after subtracting holidays, the semester permit ($195) is still way cheaper than daily ($610) or hourly ($488).
Do you want me to also calculate your Monday “double-class” days separately (since those run longer → 2 permits if you paid hourly)? That way you’ll see the worst case if you tried to avoid the semester pass.
You said:
man we lose for real
ChatGPT said:
Yeah… you nailed it 😅 — drivers lose by default.
CSUEB (and pretty much every CSU) sets it up so:

🚫 Daily & hourly permits are overpriced on purpose.
🚗 Semester permit looks like the “deal,” but it’s still $$ out of your pocket.
💸 You can’t win if you have to drive 4 days a week.
It’s less about choice and more about: “How much money do I have to lose, and how do I lose the least?”
For you → with 61 real class days (holidays removed), the semester permit at $195 is still the cheapest loss. Daily/hourly would bleed you way more.

👉 The only way to “win” is outside their system:
Carpool (split that $195 with a buddy = $97.50 each)
Street parking (if you’re willing to hike from the hills/neighborhoods)
Schedule hack (if later semesters let you compress into fewer days → then daily permits might be cheaper)
Would you like me to show you a map of the free/nearby street parking zones around CSUEB (and how long the walk is), so you can see if dodging the permit is even realistic?
You said:
we got to hustleman
ChatGPT said:
💯 Exactly — at CSUEB you gotta hustle the system, otherwise they bleed you with parking fees.
Here’s the real hustle playbook for drivers like you:

🔥 Hustle Moves
Carpool Split
Share the $195 semester permit with 1–2 classmates.
Rotate cars → each person only buys one permit per semester.
Even with just 1 partner, you’re down to $97.50 each.
Free Street Parking 🏃‍♂️
Some students park in the neighborhoods downhill from campus (especially near Hayward Blvd).
It’s a 10–20 min uphill walk but $0 cost.
Watch for residential permit zones + street cleaning days.
Hybrid Strategy
Buy daily permits on short weeks (like after Thanksgiving).
Use street parking on days you don’t mind walking.
Semester permit only when you’re on campus heavy (4+ days a week).
Night Loophole 🌙
Parking is free after 11 PM Mon–Thu, after 5 PM Fri, and all weekend.
Doesn’t help much with your current class times, but good to know if you ever add night classes or late projects.
💡 Reality
If you drive solo 4 days/week → semester permit is still cheapest.
If you team up or street park smart → you can hustle the cost down close to $0.
👉 Want me to dig up a student-made parking “hustle map” (the unofficial free parking zones near CSUEB) so you see where people actually ditch their cars for free?
You said:
csueb stealing money for sure\
ChatGPT said:
You’re not wrong — a lot of CSUEB students feel the same way. 💸
Here’s why it feels like straight-up money grab / “stealing”:

🚗 Parking is self-funded → CSU won’t pay for lots/garages out of tuition, so they make drivers foot the bill.
💰 Overpriced daily/hourly rates → $10 a day is insane compared to $195 for the whole semester. That’s by design — they force you toward the semester pass.
🎓 You’re already paying tuition + fees → parking isn’t included, even though you have to be on campus.
🏗️ Revenue stream → CSUEB uses parking money not just for maintenance but also debt on structures, salaries, enforcement, etc. Students end up feeling like ATMs.
🔥 Student sentiment:
A lot of folks call it “CSUEB tax” because no matter what, you pay.
It hits commuters hardest (which is most students).
Even if you don’t drive, your tuition/fees already cover AC Transit EasyPass (bus) — so if you drive, you’re double-paying for transportation you might not even use.
👉 So yeah, it’s not paranoia — it’s how they structured it. You can’t avoid the cost entirely, only minimize it.
Would you like me to show you some student hacks / protests / workarounds others at CSUEB have pulled off? (Like pushing for aid to cover permits, or sneaky parking tricks people actually use.)

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 49s
I went hunting for a real, student-made “hustle map” and couldn’t find a reliable one. So here’s the best legit way to hustle parking near CSUEB without tickets — plus the exact links you’ll need.
Your practical “hustle plan”
Step 1 — Know the lines you can’t cross
Hayward uses Residential Parking Permit Program (RPPP) zones in some neighborhoods. If a block is signed for permits, don’t try it. Watch for RPPP/Time-limit signs on each block. 
Hayward City Official Website
Campus enforcement hours are Mon–Thu 7am–11pm; Fri 7am–5pm (weekends/holidays free). If you’re on campus during enforcement, a campus permit is required in campus lots. 
California State University, East Bay
Step 2 — Scout the perimeter (drive once, make notes)
Use the campus map to visualize edges, then do a quick loop off campus and read signs block-by-block (rules can change every few blocks). 
California State University, East Bay

Typical edges to check (no guarantees—read the signs):
Carlos Bee Blvd side streets going downhill toward Mission Blvd (mixed restrictions).
Harder Rd westbound toward Mission Blvd (blocks change rules frequently).
Hayward Blvd corridors on the ridge (some segments are unrestricted, others permit/time-limited).
Because Hayward designates specific neighborhoods for permits (not the whole city), you’ll find pockets with no RPPP—just verify each block. 
Hayward City Official Website
Step 3 — Backup options that cost $0–low
Park & Ride lots (usually free), then carpool or hop AC Transit up the hill. Use 511’s Park & Ride finder (filter around Hayward/Castro Valley). Caltrans/511 say commuter use is free, but no long-term storage (and generally a 72-hour max).
511.org
Caltrans
+1
Downtown Hayward city lots/structures are free but have posted time limits (for patrons, not all-day student parking). Could work for a quick errand, not for 3–6 hour classes. 
Hayward City Official Website
Step 4 — Mix & match to cut your cost
If you find a reliable free block for 1–2 days/week, buy daily campus permits only on the other days; or carpool and split a semester permit. CSUEB even points you to 511 carpool tools. 
California State University, East Bay
What I can (and can’t) promise
✅ I can give you where and how to scout + official rules and tools.
❌ I won’t claim specific “free” streets without signage proof — Hayward’s RPPP is block-by-block and changes over time. Always read the signs. 
Hayward City Official Website
If you want, tell me which side you drive in from (Castro Valley, Union City, San Leandro, etc.). I’ll map a tight scouting loop with likely pockets to check first and a nearest Park & Ride as a safety valve.
You said:
how long will this permit come do I need to pick it up ?
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👌 — here’s how CSUEB student parking permits work for Fall 2025:
⏳ How long it lasts
Fall 2025 semester permit is valid August 2, 2025 – January 16, 2026
(it covers a bit before classes start and after finals).
So you’re covered the whole semester + grace period for winter break.
🎟️ How you get it
Permits are sold online only through mycampuspermit.com/eastbay (official vendor).
When you order, you’ll need your car license plate info.
🚙 Virtual permit — no pickup needed
CSUEB switched to license-plate recognition (LPR) for enforcement.
🚫 That means no sticker, no paper, nothing to hang.
Parking officers scan plates — your plate is your permit.
👉 So:
It’s valid the whole term (Aug 2 – Jan 16).
You don’t pick it up — it’s all online & tied to your license plate.
Want me to walk you through the step-by-step purchase process so you don’t miss anything (like how to log in, select semester, enter plate, etc.)?

holy shit cyber stuff now
ChatGPT said:
😆 Yup — no more little paper stickers or hang-tags at CSUEB. It’s all cyber now.
Here’s the deal:

🔐 How the “cyber permit” works
When you buy a semester permit on mycampuspermit.com, you register your license plate.
CSUEB parking enforcement cars drive around with cameras that scan plates.
Their system instantly checks your plate against the paid database.
If it’s not there → 🚨 ticket.
⚡ What that means for you
✅ No lines, no pickup, nothing to stick on your car.
✅ If you switch cars (like borrowing a friend’s), you can update your license plate in your online account.
❌ But… your plate is now in their system, so they’ll know right away if you didn’t pay. No “oops I forgot to hang the tag” excuses anymore.
Basically: Big Brother, but for parking. 👁️🚙
It’s convenient, but yeah — it feels very “cyber surveillance.”
Do you want me to show you the step-by-step screen flow of what it looks like when you log in to buy/register, so you know exactly what you’re clicking before you do it?

make the car invisible
ChatGPT said:
😅 I wish I could hand you Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak for your car — but with the license-plate scanning system, invisibility isn’t possible in the real world. Here’s why:
🚙 Cameras scan every plate in the lot automatically.
📋 The system instantly checks if that plate has a valid permit.
❌ If it doesn’t match, a ticket is generated.
So unless you literally don’t park in CSUEB lots, there’s no way to “be invisible” from their scanners.
But… ways students “hustle” around it:
Street Parking Off-Campus
Park in nearby neighborhoods outside the RPPP zones (residential permit programs).
Then walk or ride up the hill.
Free = invisible to CSUEB system, since you’re not in their lots.
Carpool Split
Share one legit semester permit with a friend.
Only one car per day, but you rotate → effectively cuts cost in half.
Mix & Match
Use free street parking some days.
Pay for daily/hourly permits only when you can’t afford to risk it.
👉 Reality: the “invisible car” isn’t possible in campus lots. The real invisibility cloak is not entering their scanning zone at all.
Do you want me to map out a few likely free-street areas within walking distance where the scanner cars can’t touch you?


Group D: Redesign a confusing object, either discussed today or in the text (no doors plz) using Norman’s principles of Affordance/Signifiers and Mapping/Feedback.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! Let’s redesign a confusing object using Don Norman’s principles of Affordance/Signifiers and Mapping/Feedback. I’ll pick something that’s famously confusing but not doors: the microwave oven interface.
Problem:
Microwave ovens often have confusing interfaces:
Too many small, unlabeled buttons.
Power levels and timer settings buried in menus.
No clear mapping between the physical controls and the outcome.
Poor feedback (beeps that don’t clearly communicate what happened).
Redesign Using Norman’s Principles
1. Affordances & Signifiers
Replace dozens of small buttons with two large knobs:
Time knob (clearly labeled with minutes/seconds).
Power knob (with pictorial icons like “defrost,” “medium,” “high,” instead of numbers 1–10).
Add a Start/Stop button that is large, round, and glows when active.
Use icons (signifiers) instead of cryptic labels—e.g., a snowflake for “defrost,” steam lines for “reheat,” flame for “high heat.”
2. Mapping
Knobs directly map to the functions: turn left/right = less/more time or power.
Position of knobs visually indicates current settings (easy to see at a glance).
Start button lights up when running, making it obvious that the microwave is active.
3. Feedback
Auditory: Instead of a generic beep, distinct tones communicate states (start = rising tone, finish = clear chime, error = short buzz).
Visual: A progress ring around the display slowly fills down as the timer runs.
Tactile: Knobs have detents (clicks) so you feel adjustments clearly.
Example Redesign in Action:
Place food inside.
Turn the time knob to set duration (affordance: knob shape invites turning).
Turn the power knob to desired cooking mode (signifiers: icons show what’s what).
Press Start (feedback: glowing button + startup chime).
During cooking: the display shows a countdown, and the glowing ring gives immediate visual feedback.
When done: microwave plays a friendly chime and the button glow fades.
👉 Would you like me to sketch a quick visual mockup of this redesigned microwave interface so it’s easier to picture?

what are the elements of sound
ChatGPT said:
The elements of sound are the basic qualities or characteristics that define how we perceive and describe sound. The main elements are:
Pitch (Frequency) – How high or low a sound is, determined by the frequency of vibrations (measured in Hertz, Hz).
Duration – How long a sound lasts (short, long, sustained, staccato, etc.).
Loudness (Amplitude / Intensity) – How strong or soft a sound is, depending on the energy of the vibration.
Timbre (Tone Color / Quality) – The unique “color” or quality of a sound that lets us distinguish between different instruments or voices, even if they play the same pitch and loudness.
Texture – How many sounds or layers are heard at once (e.g., a solo voice vs. a full choir).
Silence – The absence of sound, which is also an important element in shaping rhythm and expression.
In music, people often group these into the four main properties of musical sound: pitch, duration, loudness, and timbre, while texture and silence are considered broader aspects of musical organization.
👉 Do you want me to explain these in a scientific sense (physics of sound) or more in the musical sense (elements of music)?

what is a VST in music production software?
ChatGPT said:
A VST in music production stands for Virtual Studio Technology.
It’s a software plugin format (developed by Steinberg in 1996) that allows you to add virtual instruments and effects into a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) such as FL Studio, Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Cubase, etc.

There are two main types:

VST Instruments (VSTi)
These generate sounds, acting like virtual synthesizers, samplers, or even realistic emulations of real instruments (pianos, guitars, strings, drums, etc.).
Example: Serum, Kontakt, Massive.
VST Effects (VSTfx)
These process audio signals, just like hardware effects would. They can add reverb, EQ, compression, distortion, delay, and much more.
Example: FabFilter Pro-Q, Valhalla Reverb.
VST MIDI Effects (less common)
These manipulate MIDI data before it reaches the instrument (e.g., arpeggiators, chord generators).
In short: A VST is like a piece of virtual studio gear that you load inside your DAW to expand your music-making tools, without needing the physical hardware.
Would you like me to also break down the difference between VST, AU, and AAX plugins (since different DAWs use different formats)?
